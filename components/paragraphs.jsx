        Welcome to the Mu Chapter of Kappa Theta Pi, The University of Texas at
        Dallas&apos;s premier professional technology fraternity. On behalf of
        our chapter, I am excited to welcome you to our fraternity&apos;s
        website, where you can catch a glimpse of the passion and excellence
        that our chapter celebrates.

        As the nation&apos;s first technology fraternity, Kappa Theta Pi offers
        brothers the support and resources to be extraordinary during their time
        at UTD. Our brotherhood is centered around five pillars: technological
        advancement, professional development, academic support, social growth,
        and alumni connections. From project teams and study groups to
        networking workshops and hackathons/design jams, we celebrate a culture
        of growth where brothers are supported and encouraged to pursue
        opportunities related to their passions for tech.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Our chapter thrives on its diversity and would not be the same without
        each and every member contributing their unique experiences and
        perspectives. In addition to their dedication to KTP, our brothers are
        student leaders for other organizations on campus, interns at many
        companies, research assistants, and instructional aides for their
        classes. During rush, we do not discriminate by school, major, gender,
        ethnicity, sexuality, or background; rather, we celebrate our
        brotherhood&apos;s diversity and ultimately all come together united by
        our passion for technology.

        Reflecting on my time at UTD, my involvement in KTP has been the most
        impactful part of my college experience. As a collective, Kappa Theta Pi
        fosters a culture of excellence as professionals, brothers, and friends.
        In KTP, I have witnessed the growth of some of UTD&apos;s most brilliant
        and ambitious professionals. I have seen first-hand the incredible
        things they can do when they put their minds and hearts into it. More
        importantly, I have been introduced to lifelong friends and connections
        who serve as a constant source of inspiration and always support me to
        be my full and best self.
      </p>
